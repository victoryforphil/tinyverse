# Rendering under the hood

You may have read in previous sections that Ratatui is an immediate mode rendering library. But what
does that really mean? And how is it implemented? In this section, we will discuss how Ratatui
renders a widget to the screen, starting with the `Terminal`’s `draw` method and ending with your
chosen backend library.

## Introduction

[Section titled “Introduction”](#introduction)

To render an UI in Ratatui, your application calls the [`Terminal::draw()`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/e5caf170c8c304b952cbff7499fd4da17ab154ea/src/terminal.rs#L325-L360) method. This method
takes a [closure](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch13-01-closures.html) which accepts an instance of [`Frame`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/e5caf170c8c304b952cbff7499fd4da17ab154ea/src/terminal.rs#L566-L578). Inside the `draw` method, applications can
call [`Frame::render_widget()`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/88ae3485c2c540b4ee630ab13e613e84efa7440a/src/terminal.rs#L596) to render the state of a widget within the available renderable
area. We only discuss the `Frame::render_widget()` on this page but this discussion about rendering
applies equally to [`Frame::render_stateful_widget()`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/88ae3485c2c540b4ee630ab13e613e84efa7440a/src/terminal.rs#L628).

As an example, here is the `terminal.draw()` call for a simple “hello world” with Ratatui.

- ``` terminal.draw(|frame| { frame.render_widget(Paragraph::new("Hello World!"), frame.area());}); ``` The closure gets an argument `frame` of type `&#x26;mut Frame`. `frame.area()` returns a `Rect` that represents the total renderable area. `Frame` also holds a reference to an intermediate buffer which it can render widgets to using the `render_widget()` method. At the end of the `draw` method (after the closure returns), Ratatui persists the content of the buffer to the terminal. Let’s walk through more specifics in the following sections. ## `Widget` trait [Section titled “Widget trait”](#widget-trait) In Ratatui, the `frame.render_widget()` method calls a `Widget::render()` method on the type-erased struct that implements the [`Widget`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/e5caf170c8c304b952cbff7499fd4da17ab154ea/src/widgets.rs#L107-L112) trait. ``` pub trait Widget { /// Draws the current state of the widget in the given buffer. fn render(self, area: Rect, buf: &#x26;mut Buffer);} ``` Any struct (inside Ratatui or third party crates) can implement the `Widget` trait, making an instance of that struct renderable to the terminal. The `Widget::render()` method is the only method required to make a struct a renderable widget. In the `Paragraph` example above, `frame.render_widget()` calls the [`Widget::render()` method implemented for `Paragraph`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/88ae3485c2c540b4ee630ab13e613e84efa7440a/src/widgets/paragraph.rs#L213-L214). You can take a look at other widgets’ `render` methods for examples of how to draw content. As a simple example, let’s take a look at the builtin `Clear` widget. The `Clear` widget resets the style information of every cell in the buffer back to the defaults. Here is the full implementation for the `Clear` widget: ``` pub struct Clear; impl Widget for Clear { fn render(self, area: Rect, buf: &#x26;mut Buffer) { for x in area.left()..area.right() { for y in area.top()..area.bottom() { buf.get_mut(x, y).reset(); } } }} ``` In the `Clear` widget example above, when the application calls the `Frame::render_widget()` method, it will call the `Clear`’s `Widget::render()` method passing it the area (a `Rect` value) and a mutable reference to the frame’s [`Buffer`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/e5caf170c8c304b952cbff7499fd4da17ab154ea/src/buffer.rs#L149-L157). You can see that the `render` loops through the entire area and calls `buf.get_mut(x, y).reset()`. Here we only use one of the many methods on `Buffer`, i.e. `get_mut(x, y)` which returns a `Cell` and `reset()` is a method on [`Cell`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/e5caf170c8c304b952cbff7499fd4da17ab154ea/src/buffer.rs#L15-L26). ## Buffer [Section titled “Buffer”](#buffer) A [`Buffer`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/e5caf170c8c304b952cbff7499fd4da17ab154ea/src/buffer.rs#L149-L157) represents a rectangular area that covers the Terminal’s [`Viewport`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/88ae3485c2c540b4ee630ab13e613e84efa7440a/src/terminal.rs#L41-L65) which the application can draw into by manipulating its contents. A `Buffer` contains a collection of [`Cell`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/e5caf170c8c304b952cbff7499fd4da17ab154ea/src/buffer.rs#L15-L26)s to represent the rows and columns of the terminal’s display area. As we saw in the `Clear` example above, widgets interact with these `Cell`s using `Buffer` methods. Here’s a visual representation of a `Buffer` that is 12 `Cell`s wide and 4 `Cell`s tall. In Ratatui, a `Cell` struct is the smallest renderable unit of code. Each `Cell` tracks symbol and style information (foreground color, background color, modifiers etc). `Cell`s are similar to a “pixel” in a graphical UI. Terminals generally render text so that each individual cell takes up space approximately twice as high as it is wide. A `Cell` in Ratatui should usually contain 1 wide string content. `Buffer` implements methods to write text, set styles on particular areas and manipulate individual cells. For example, `buf.get_mut(0, 0)` will return a `Cell` with the symbol and style information for row = 0 and col = 0.

- `buf.set_string(0, 0, "Hello World!", Style::default())` will render `hello world` into the `Buffer` starting at row = 0 and col = 0 with the style set to default for all those cells.

These methods allow any implementation of the `Widget` trait to write into different parts of the
`Buffer`.

Every time your application calls `terminal.draw(|frame| ...)`, Ratatui passes into the closure a
new instance of [`Frame`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/e5caf170c8c304b952cbff7499fd4da17ab154ea/src/terminal.rs#L566-L578) which contains a mutable reference to an instance of `Buffer`. Ratatui
widgets render to this intermediate buffer before any information is written to the terminal and any
content rendered to a `Buffer` is only stored in the `Buffer` that is attached to the frame during
the `draw` call. This is in contrast to using a library like `crossterm` directly, where writing
text to terminal can occur immediately.

Note

ANSI Escape sequences for color and style that are stored in the cell’s string content are not
rendered, as the style information is stored separately in the cell. If your text has ANSI styling
info, consider using the [`ansi-to-tui`](https://crates.io/crates/ansi-to-tui) crate to convert it
to a `Text` value before rendering. You can learn more about the text related Ratatui features and
displaying text [here](/recipes/render/display-text/).

## `flush()`

[Section titled “flush()”](#flush)

After the closure provided to the `draw` method finishes, the `draw` method calls
[`Terminal::flush()`](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/e5caf170c8c304b952cbff7499fd4da17ab154ea/src/terminal.rs#L253-L263). `flush()` writes the content of the buffer to the terminal. Ratatui uses a
double buffer approach. It calculates a `diff` between the current buffer and the previous buffer to
figure out what content to write to the terminal screen efficiently. After `flush()`, Ratatui swaps
the buffers and the next time it calls `terminal.draw(|frame| ...)` it constructs `Frame` with the
other `Buffer`.

Because all widgets render to the same `Buffer` within a single `terminal.draw(|frame| ...)` call,
rendering of different widgets may overwrite the same `Cell` in the buffer. This means the order in
which widgets are rendered will affect the final UI.

For example, in this `draw` example below, `"content1"` will be overwritten by `"content2"` which
will be overwritten by `"content3"` in `Buffer`, and Ratatui will only ever write out `"content3"`
to the terminal:

```
terminal.draw(|frame| {    frame.render_widget(Paragraph::new("content1"), frame.area());    frame.render_widget(Paragraph::new("content2"), frame.area());    frame.render_widget(Paragraph::new("content3"), frame.area());})
```

Before a new `Frame` is constructed, Ratatui wipes the current buffer clean. Because of this, when
an application calls `terminal.draw()` it must draw all the widgets it expects to be rendered to the
terminal, and not just a part of the frame. The diffing algorithm in Ratatui ensures efficient
writing to the terminal screen.

## Conclusion

[Section titled “Conclusion”](#conclusion)

In summary, the application calls `terminal.draw(|frame| ...)`, and the terminal constructs a frame
that is passed to the closure provided by the application. The closure draws each widget to the
buffer by calling the `Frame::render_widget`, which in turn calls each widget’s render method.
Finally, Ratatui writes the contents of the buffer to the terminal.
