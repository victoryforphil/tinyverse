# Basic Counter App

A full copy of the code for this page is available in the github repository for the website at:

[https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui-website/tree/main/code/tutorials/counter-app-basic](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui-website/tree/main/code/tutorials/counter-app-basic).

## Create a new project

[Section titled “Create a new project”](#create-a-new-project)

Create a new rust project and open it in your editor

- create counter app project ``` cargo new ratatui-counter-appcd ratatui-counter-app$EDITOR . ``` Add the Ratatui and Crossterm crates (See [backends](/concepts/backends/) for more info on why we use Crossterm). add dependencies ``` cargo add ratatui crossterm ``` The Cargo.toml will now have the following in the dependencies section: Cargo.toml ``` [dependencies]ratatui = "0.30.0"crossterm = "0.29.0" ``` ## Application Setup [Section titled “Application Setup”](#application-setup) ### Main Imports [Section titled “Main Imports”](#main-imports) In `main.rs`, add the necessary imports for Ratatui and crossterm. These will be used later in this tutorial. In the tutorials, we generally use wildcard imports to simplify the code, but you’re welcome to use explicit imports if that is your preferred style. src/main.rs ``` use std::io; use crossterm::event::{self, Event, KeyCode, KeyEvent, KeyEventKind};use ratatui::{ buffer::Buffer, layout::Rect, style::Stylize, symbols::border, text::{Line, Text}, widgets::{Block, Paragraph, Widget}, DefaultTerminal, Frame,}; ``` CautionSome editors remove unused imports automatically, so if you run into errors about missing types, etc. make sure these are in place, and double-check that shared imports like `Stylize` come from ratatui and not crossterm to avoid conflicts. ### Main Function [Section titled “Main Function”](#main-function) A common pattern found in most Ratatui apps is that they: Initialize the terminal

- Run the application in a loop until the user exits the app

- Restore the terminal back to its original state

The `main` function calls `ratatui::run()`. The `ratatui::run()` function sets up the terminal by
calling the `ratatui::init` and `ratatui::restore` methods and then creates and runs the App
(defined later). It defers propagating the return of `App::run()`’s result until after the terminal
is restored to ensure that any `Error` results will be displayed to the user after the application
exits.

Fill out the main function:

src/main.rs

```
fn main() -> io::Result&#x3C;()> {    ratatui::run(|terminal| App::default().run(terminal))}
```

### Application State

[Section titled “Application State”](#application-state)

The counter app needs to store a small amount of state, a counter and a flag to indicate that the
application should exit. The counter will be an 8-bit unsigned int, and the exit flag can be a
simple bool. Applications that have more than one main state or mode might instead use an enum to
represent this flag.

Create an `App` struct to represent your application’s state:

src/main.rs

```
#[derive(Debug, Default)]pub struct App {    counter: u8,    exit: bool,}
```

Calling `App::default()` will create an `App` initialized with `counter` set to 0, and `exit` set to
`false`.

### Application Main loop

[Section titled “Application Main loop”](#application-main-loop)

Most apps have a main loop that runs until the user chooses to exit. Each iteration of the loop
draws a single frame by calling `Terminal::draw()` and then updates the state of the app.

Create an `impl` block for the `App` with a new run method that will act as the application’s main
loop:

src/main.rs

```
impl App {
    /// runs the application's main loop until the user quits    pub fn run(&#x26;mut self, terminal: &#x26;mut DefaultTerminal) -> io::Result&#x3C;()> {        while !self.exit {            terminal.draw(|frame| self.draw(frame))?;            self.handle_events()?;        }        Ok(())    }
    fn draw(&#x26;self, frame: &#x26;mut Frame) {        todo!()    }
    fn handle_events(&#x26;mut self) -> io::Result&#x3C;()> {        todo!()    }}
```

## Displaying the application

[Section titled “Displaying the application”](#displaying-the-application)

### Render a Frame

[Section titled “Render a Frame”](#render-a-frame)

To render the UI, an application calls `Terminal::draw()` with a closure that accepts a `Frame`. The
most important method on `Frame` is `render_widget()` which renders any type that implements the
[`Widget` trait](/concepts/widgets) such as `Paragraph`, `List` etc. We will implement the `Widget`
trait for the `App` struct so that the code related to rendering is organized in a single place.
This allows us to call `Frame::render_widget()` with the app in the closure passed to
`Terminal::draw`.

First, add a new `impl Widget for &#x26;App` block. We implement this on a reference to the App type, as
the render function will not mutate any state, and we want to be able to use the app after the call
to draw. The render function will create a block with a title, instruction text on the bottom, and
some borders. Render a `Paragraph` widget with the application’s state (the value of the `App`s
counter field) inside the block. The block and paragraph will take up the entire size of the widget:

src/main.rs

```
impl Widget for &#x26;App {    fn render(self, area: Rect, buf: &#x26;mut Buffer) {        let title = Line::from(" Counter App Tutorial ".bold());        let instructions = Line::from(vec![            " Decrement ".into(),            "&#x3C;Left>".blue().bold(),            " Increment ".into(),            "&#x3C;Right>".blue().bold(),            " Quit ".into(),            "&#x3C;Q> ".blue().bold(),        ]);        let block = Block::bordered()            .title(title.centered())            .title_bottom(instructions.centered())            .border_set(border::THICK);
        let counter_text = Text::from(vec![Line::from(vec![            "Value: ".into(),            self.counter.to_string().yellow(),        ])]);
        Paragraph::new(counter_text)            .centered()            .block(block)            .render(area, buf);    }}
```

Next, render the app as a widget:

src/main.rs

```
impl App {    fn draw(&#x26;self, frame: &#x26;mut Frame) {        frame.render_widget(self, frame.area());    }}
```

Note

The closure (anonymous method) passed to the `Terminal::draw()` method must render the entire UI.
You should only call the draw method once for each pass through your application’s main loop.
[See the FAQ for more information.](/faq/)

### Testing the UI Output

[Section titled “Testing the UI Output”](#testing-the-ui-output)

To test how Ratatui will display the widget when `render` is called, you can render the app to a
buffer in a test.

Add the following `tests` module to `main.rs`:

src/main.rs

```
#[cfg(test)]mod tests {    use super::*;    use ratatui::style::Style;
    #[test]    fn render() {        let app = App::default();        let mut buf = Buffer::empty(Rect::new(0, 0, 50, 4));
        app.render(buf.area, &#x26;mut buf);
        let mut expected = Buffer::with_lines(vec![            "┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Counter App Tutorial ━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓",            "┃                    Value: 0                    ┃",            "┃                                                ┃",            "┗━ Decrement &#x3C;Left> Increment &#x3C;Right> Quit &#x3C;Q> ━━┛",        ]);        let title_style = Style::new().bold();        let counter_style = Style::new().yellow();        let key_style = Style::new().blue().bold();        expected.set_style(Rect::new(14, 0, 22, 1), title_style);        expected.set_style(Rect::new(28, 1, 1, 1), counter_style);        expected.set_style(Rect::new(13, 3, 6, 1), key_style);        expected.set_style(Rect::new(30, 3, 7, 1), key_style);        expected.set_style(Rect::new(43, 3, 4, 1), key_style);
        assert_eq!(buf, expected);    }}
```

To run this test run the following in your terminal:

run tests

```
cargo test
```

You should see:

test output

```
running 1 testtest tests::render ... ok
test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```

## Interactivity

[Section titled “Interactivity”](#interactivity)

The application needs to accept events that come from the user via the standard input. The only
events this application needs to worry about are key events. For information on other available
events, see the [Crossterm events module](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/index.html) docs. These include window resize and focus, paste, and
mouse events.

In more advanced applications, events might come from the system, over the network, or from other
parts of the application.

### Handle Events

[Section titled “Handle Events”](#handle-events)

The `handle_events` method that you defined earlier is where the app will wait for and handle any
events that are provided to it from crossterm.

Update the `handle_events` method that you defined earlier:

src/main.rs

```
impl App {
    // -- snip --
    /// updates the application's state based on user input    fn handle_events(&#x26;mut self) -> io::Result&#x3C;()> {        match event::read()? {            // it's important to check that the event is a key press event as            // crossterm also emits key release and repeat events on Windows.            Event::Key(key_event) if key_event.kind == KeyEventKind::Press => {                self.handle_key_event(key_event)            }            _ => {}        };        Ok(())    }}
```

Note

The [`event::read`](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/fn.read.html) function blocks until there is an event. If your application needs to perform
other tasks than just the UI, then it should check whether there is a pending event by calling
[`event::poll`](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/fn.poll.html) with a timeout that is reasonable for your application. More about this will be
covered in a future chapter.

### Handle Keyboard Events

[Section titled “Handle Keyboard Events”](#handle-keyboard-events)

Your counter app will update the state of the `App` struct’s fields based on the key that was
pressed. The keyboard event has two fields of interest to this app:

- `kind`: It’s important to check that this equals `KeyEventKind::Press` as otherwise your application may see duplicate events (for key down, key repeat, and key up).

- `code`: the `KeyCode` representing which specific key that was pressed.

Add a `handle_key_event` method to `App`, to handle the key events.

src/main.rs

```
impl App {
    // -- snip --
    fn handle_key_event(&#x26;mut self, key_event: KeyEvent) {        match key_event.code {            KeyCode::Char('q') => self.exit(),            KeyCode::Left => self.decrement_counter(),            KeyCode::Right => self.increment_counter(),            _ => {}        }    }}
```

Next, add some methods to handle updating the application’s state. It’s usually a good idea to
define these on the app rather than just in the match statement as it gives you an easy way to unit
test the application’s behavior separately to the events.

src/main.rs

```
impl App {
    // -- snip --
    fn exit(&#x26;mut self) {        self.exit = true;    }
    fn increment_counter(&#x26;mut self) {        self.counter += 1;    }
    fn decrement_counter(&#x26;mut self) {        self.counter -= 1;    }}
```

Caution

Normally your application should avoid panicking, but we’re leaving an overflow bug in here so we
can show how to handle errors in the next section. A real app might use `saturating_sub` and
`saturating_add` to avoid panics like this.

### Testing Keyboard Events

[Section titled “Testing Keyboard Events”](#testing-keyboard-events)

Splitting the keyboard event handling out to a separate function like this makes it easy to test the
application without having to emulate the terminal. You can write tests that pass in keyboard events
and test the effect on the application.

Add tests for `handle_key_event` in the `tests` module.

src/main.rs

```
#[cfg(test)]mod tests {
    // -- snip --
    #[test]    fn handle_key_event() {        let mut app = App::default();        app.handle_key_event(KeyCode::Right.into());        assert_eq!(app.counter, 1);
        app.handle_key_event(KeyCode::Left.into());        assert_eq!(app.counter, 0);
        let mut app = App::default();        app.handle_key_event(KeyCode::Char('q').into());        assert!(app.exit);    }}
```

Run the tests.

run tests

```
cargo test
```

You should see:

test output

```
running 2 teststest tests::handle_key_event ... oktest tests::render ... ok
test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```

## The Finished App

```

### Running the app

[Section titled “Running the app”](#running-the-app)

Make sure you save all the files and that the [imports](#main-imports) listed above are still at the top of the
file (some editors remove unused imports automatically).

Now run the app:

run the app

```
cargo run
```

You will see the following UI:

Press the Left and Right arrow keys to interact with the counter. Press Q to quit.

Note what happens when you press Left when the counter is 0.

On a Mac / Linux console you can run `reset` to fix the console. On a Windows console, you may need
to restart the console to clear the problem. We will properly handle this in the next section of
this tutorial on [Error Handling](/tutorials/counter-app/error-handling/).

## Conclusion

[Section titled “Conclusion”](#conclusion)

By understanding the structure and components used in this simple counter application, you are set
up to explore crafting more intricate terminal-based interfaces using `ratatui`.
