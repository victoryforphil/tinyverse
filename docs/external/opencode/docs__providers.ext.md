# Providers

Using any LLM provider in OpenCode.

OpenCode uses the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) and [Models.dev](https://models.dev) to support 75+ LLM providers and it supports running local models.

To add a provider you need to:

- Add the API keys for the provider using the `/connect` command.

- Configure the provider in your OpenCode config.

### [Credentials](#credentials)

When you add a provider’s API keys with the `/connect` command, they are stored
in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`.

### [Config](#config)

You can customize the providers through the `provider` section in your OpenCode
config.

#### [Base URL](#base-url)

You can customize the base URL for any provider by setting the `baseURL` option. This is useful when using proxy services or custom endpoints.

- opencode.json ``` { "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json", "provider": { "anthropic": { "options": { "baseURL": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1" } } }} ``` ## [OpenCode Zen](#opencode-zen) OpenCode Zen is a list of models provided by the OpenCode team that have been tested and verified to work well with OpenCode. [Learn more](/docs/zen). TipIf you are new, we recommend starting with OpenCode Zen. Run the `/connect` command in the TUI, select opencode, and head to [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth). ``` /connect ```

- Sign in, add your billing details, and copy your API key.

- Paste your API key. ``` ┌ API key││└ enter ```

- Run `/models` in the TUI to see the list of models we recommend. ``` /models ```

It works like any other provider in OpenCode and is completely optional to use.

## [Directory](#directory)

Let’s look at some of the providers in detail. If you’d like to add a provider to the
list, feel free to open a PR.

### [302.AI](#302ai)

- Head over to the [302.AI console](https://302.ai/), create an account, and generate an API key.

- Run the `/connect` command and search for 302.AI. ``` /connect ```

- Enter your 302.AI API key. ``` ┌ API key││└ enter ```

- Run the `/models` command to select a model. ``` /models ```

### [Amazon Bedrock](#amazon-bedrock)

To use Amazon Bedrock with OpenCode:

- Head over to the Model catalog in the Amazon Bedrock console and request access to the models you want. TipYou need to have access to the model you want in Amazon Bedrock.

- Configure authentication using one of the following methods: #### [Environment Variables (Quick Start)](#environment-variables-quick-start) Set one of these environment variables while running opencode: Terminal window ``` # Option 1: Using AWS access keysAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYY opencode # Option 2: Using named AWS profileAWS_PROFILE=my-profile opencode # Option 3: Using Bedrock bearer tokenAWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=XXX opencode ``` Or add them to your bash profile: ~/.bash_profile ``` export AWS_PROFILE=my-dev-profileexport AWS_REGION=us-east-1 ``` #### [Configuration File (Recommended)](#configuration-file-recommended) For project-specific or persistent configuration, use `opencode.json`: opencode.json ``` { "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json", "provider": { "amazon-bedrock": { "options": { "region": "us-east-1", "profile": "my-aws-profile" } } }} ``` Available options: `region` - AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`)

- `profile` - AWS named profile from `~/.aws/credentials`

- `endpoint` - Custom endpoint URL for VPC endpoints (alias for generic `baseURL` option)

Tip

Configuration file options take precedence over environment variables.

#### [Advanced: VPC Endpoints](#advanced-vpc-endpoints)

If you’re using VPC endpoints for Bedrock:

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "provider": {    "amazon-bedrock": {      "options": {        "region": "us-east-1",        "profile": "production",        "endpoint": "https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.vpce-xxxxx.amazonaws.com"      }    }  }}
```

Note

The `endpoint` option is an alias for the generic `baseURL` option, using AWS-specific terminology. If both `endpoint` and `baseURL` are specified, `endpoint` takes precedence.

#### [Authentication Methods](#authentication-methods)

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Create an IAM user and generate access keys in the AWS Console

- `AWS_PROFILE`: Use named profiles from `~/.aws/credentials`. First configure with `aws configure --profile my-profile` or `aws sso login`

- `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`: Generate long-term API keys from the Amazon Bedrock console

- `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` / `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: For EKS IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) or other Kubernetes environments with OIDC federation. These environment variables are automatically injected by Kubernetes when using service account annotations.

#### [Authentication Precedence](#authentication-precedence)

Amazon Bedrock uses the following authentication priority:

- Bearer Token - `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` environment variable or token from `/connect` command

- AWS Credential Chain - Profile, access keys, shared credentials, IAM roles, Web Identity Tokens (EKS IRSA), instance metadata

Note

When a bearer token is set (via `/connect` or `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`), it takes precedence over all AWS credential methods including configured profiles.

- Run the `/models` command to select the model you want. ``` /models ```

Note

For custom inference profiles, use the model and provider name in the key and set the `id` property to the arn. This ensures correct caching:

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "provider": {    "amazon-bedrock": {      // ...      "models": {        "anthropic-claude-sonnet-4.5": {          "id": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:xxx:application-inference-profile/yyy"        }      }    }  }}
```

### [Anthropic](#anthropic)

- Once you’ve signed up, run the `/connect` command and select Anthropic. ``` /connect ```

- Here you can select the Claude Pro/Max option and it’ll open your browser and ask you to authenticate. ``` ┌ Select auth method││ Claude Pro/Max│ Create an API Key│ Manually enter API Key└ ```

- Now all the Anthropic models should be available when you use the `/models` command. ``` /models ```

Using your Claude Pro/Max subscription in OpenCode is not officially supported by [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com).

##### [Using API keys](#using-api-keys)

You can also select Create an API Key if you don’t have a Pro/Max subscription. It’ll also open your browser and ask you to login to Anthropic and give you a code you can paste in your terminal.

Or if you already have an API key, you can select Manually enter API Key and paste it in your terminal.

### [Azure OpenAI](#azure-openai)

##### [Self-Hosted GitLab](#self-hosted-gitlab)

compliance note

OpenCode uses a small model for some AI tasks like generating the session title.
It is configured to use gpt-5-nano by default, hosted by Zen. To lock OpenCode
to only use your own GitLab-hosted instance, add the following to your
`opencode.json` file. It is also recommended to disable session sharing.

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "small_model": "gitlab/duo-chat-haiku-4-5",  "share": "disabled"}
```

For self-hosted GitLab instances:

Terminal window

```
export GITLAB_INSTANCE_URL=https://gitlab.company.comexport GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-...
```

If your instance runs a custom AI Gateway:

Terminal window

```
GITLAB_AI_GATEWAY_URL=https://ai-gateway.company.com
```

Or add to your bash profile:

~/.bash_profile

```
export GITLAB_INSTANCE_URL=https://gitlab.company.comexport GITLAB_AI_GATEWAY_URL=https://ai-gateway.company.comexport GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-...
```

Note

Your GitLab administrator must enable the following:

- [Duo Agent Platform](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/turn_on_off/) for the user, group, or instance

- Feature flags (via Rails console): `agent_platform_claude_code`

- `third_party_agents_enabled`

##### [OAuth for Self-Hosted instances](#oauth-for-self-hosted-instances)

In order to make Oauth working for your self-hosted instance, you need to create
a new application (Settings → Applications) with the
callback URL `http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback` and following scopes:

- api (Access the API on your behalf)

- read_user (Read your personal information)

- read_repository (Allows read-only access to the repository)

Then expose application ID as environment variable:

Terminal window

```
export GITLAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_application_id_here
```

More documentation on [opencode-gitlab-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gitlab/opencode-gitlab-auth) homepage.

##### [Configuration](#configuration)

Customize through `opencode.json`:

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "provider": {    "gitlab": {      "options": {        "instanceUrl": "https://gitlab.com",        "featureFlags": {          "duo_agent_platform_agentic_chat": true,          "duo_agent_platform": true        }      }    }  }}
```

### [Google Vertex AI](#google-vertex-ai)

To use Google Vertex AI with OpenCode:

- Head over to the Model Garden in the Google Cloud Console and check the models available in your region. NoteYou need to have a Google Cloud project with Vertex AI API enabled.

- Set the required environment variables: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: Your Google Cloud project ID

- `VERTEX_LOCATION` (optional): The region for Vertex AI (defaults to `global`)

- Authentication (choose one): `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Path to your service account JSON key file

- Authenticate using gcloud CLI: `gcloud auth application-default login`

Set them while running opencode.

Terminal window

```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account.json GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id opencode
```

Or add them to your bash profile.

~/.bash_profile

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account.jsonexport GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-idexport VERTEX_LOCATION=global
```

Tip

The `global` region improves availability and reduces errors at no extra cost. Use regional endpoints (e.g., `us-central1`) for data residency requirements. [Learn more](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-partner-models#regional_and_global_endpoints)

- Run the `/connect` command and search for Helicone. ``` /connect ```

- Enter your Helicone API key. ``` ┌ API key││└ enter ```

- Run the `/models` command to select a model. ``` /models ```

For more providers and advanced features like caching and rate limiting, check the [Helicone documentation](https://docs.helicone.ai).

#### [Optional Configs](#optional-configs)

In the event you see a feature or model from Helicone that isn’t configured automatically through opencode, you can always configure it yourself.

Here’s [Helicone’s Model Directory](https://helicone.ai/models), you’ll need this to grab the IDs of the models you want to add.

~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "provider": {    "helicone": {      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",      "name": "Helicone",      "options": {        "baseURL": "https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai",      },      "models": {        "gpt-4o": {          // Model ID (from Helicone's model directory page)          "name": "GPT-4o", // Your own custom name for the model        },        "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": {          "name": "Claude Sonnet 4",        },      },    },  },}
```

#### [Custom Headers](#custom-headers)

Helicone supports custom headers for features like caching, user tracking, and session management. Add them to your provider config using `options.headers`:

~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "provider": {    "helicone": {      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",      "name": "Helicone",      "options": {        "baseURL": "https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai",        "headers": {          "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true",          "Helicone-User-Id": "opencode",        },      },    },  },}
```

##### [Session tracking](#session-tracking)

Helicone’s [Sessions](https://docs.helicone.ai/features/sessions) feature lets you group related LLM requests together. Use the [opencode-helicone-session](https://github.com/H2Shami/opencode-helicone-session) plugin to automatically log each OpenCode conversation as a session in Helicone.

Terminal window

```
npm install -g opencode-helicone-session
```

Add it to your config.

opencode.json

```
{  "plugin": ["opencode-helicone-session"]}
```

The plugin injects `Helicone-Session-Id` and `Helicone-Session-Name` headers into your requests. In Helicone’s Sessions page, you’ll see each OpenCode conversation listed as a separate session.

##### [Common Helicone headers](#common-helicone-headers)

Header Description

`Helicone-Cache-Enabled` Enable response caching (`true`/`false`)

`Helicone-User-Id` Track metrics by user

`Helicone-Property-[Name]` Add custom properties (e.g., `Helicone-Property-Environment`)

`Helicone-Prompt-Id` Associate requests with prompt versions

See the [Helicone Header Directory](https://docs.helicone.ai/helicone-headers/header-directory) for all available headers.

### [llama.cpp](#llamacpp)

- `npm` specifies the package to use for this provider. Here, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` is used for any OpenAI-compatible API.

- `name` is the display name for the provider in the UI.

- `options.baseURL` is the endpoint for the local server.

- `models` is a map of model IDs to their configurations. The model name will be displayed in the model selection list.

Tip

If tool calls aren’t working, try increasing `num_ctx` in Ollama. Start around 16k - 32k.

## [Custom provider](#custom-provider)

To add any OpenAI-compatible provider that’s not listed in the `/connect` command:

Tip

You can use any OpenAI-compatible provider with opencode. Most modern AI providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs.

- Run the `/connect` command and scroll down to Other. Terminal window ``` $ /connect ┌ Add credential│◆ Select provider│ ...│ ● Other└ ```

- Enter a unique ID for the provider. Terminal window ``` $ /connect ┌ Add credential│◇ Enter provider id│ myprovider└ ``` NoteChoose a memorable ID, you’ll use this in your config file.

- Enter your API key for the provider. Terminal window ``` $ /connect ┌ Add credential│▲ This only stores a credential for myprovider - you will need to configure it in opencode.json, check the docs for examples.│◇ Enter your API key│ sk-...└ ```

- Create or update your `opencode.json` file in your project directory: opencode.json ``` { "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json", "provider": { "myprovider": { "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible", "name": "My AI ProviderDisplay Name", "options": { "baseURL": "https://api.myprovider.com/v1" }, "models": { "my-model-name": { "name": "My Model Display Name" } } } }} ``` Here are the configuration options: npm: AI SDK package to use, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` for OpenAI-compatible providers

- name: Display name in UI.

- models: Available models.

- options.baseURL: API endpoint URL.

- options.apiKey: Optionally set the API key, if not using auth.

- options.headers: Optionally set custom headers.

More on the advanced options in the example below.

- Run the `/models` command and your custom provider and models will appear in the selection list.

##### [Example](#example)

Here’s an example setting the `apiKey`, `headers`, and model `limit` options.

opencode.json

```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "provider": {    "myprovider": {      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",      "name": "My AI ProviderDisplay Name",      "options": {        "baseURL": "https://api.myprovider.com/v1",        "apiKey": "{env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}",        "headers": {          "Authorization": "Bearer custom-token"        }      },      "models": {        "my-model-name": {          "name": "My Model Display Name",          "limit": {            "context": 200000,            "output": 65536          }        }      }    }  }}
```

Configuration details:

- apiKey: Set using `env` variable syntax, [learn more](/docs/config#env-vars).

- headers: Custom headers sent with each request.

- limit.context: Maximum input tokens the model accepts.

- limit.output: Maximum tokens the model can generate.

The `limit` fields allow OpenCode to understand how much context you have left. Standard providers pull these from models.dev automatically.

## [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

If you are having trouble with configuring a provider, check the following:

- Check the auth setup: Run `opencode auth list` to see if the credentials for the provider are added to your config. This doesn’t apply to providers like Amazon Bedrock, that rely on environment variables for their auth.

- For custom providers, check the opencode config and: Make sure the provider ID used in the `/connect` command matches the ID in your opencode config.

- The right npm package is used for the provider. For example, use `@ai-sdk/cerebras` for Cerebras. And for all other OpenAI-compatible providers, use `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`.

- Check correct API endpoint is used in the `options.baseURL` field.
