Documentation is currently for [moon v2](/blog/moon-v2-alpha) and latest proto. Documentation for moon v1 has been frozen and can be [found here](https://moonrepo.github.io/website-v1/).

# Root-level project

Coming from other repositories or task runner, you may be familiar with tasks available at the
repository root, in which one-off, organization, maintenance, or process oriented tasks can be ran.
moon supports this through a concept known as a root-level project.

Begin by adding the root to [`projects`](/docs/config/workspace#projects) with a source value of `.`
(current directory relative from the workspace).

.moon/workspace.yml

```
# As a mapprojects:  root: '.'# As a list of globsprojects:  - '.'
```

When using globs, the root project's name will be inferred from the repository folder name. Be
wary of this as it can change based on what a developer has checked out as.

Once added, create a [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project) in the root of the repository. From here you
can define tasks that can be ran using this new root-level project name, for example,
`moon run root:`.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  versionCheck:    command: 'yarn version check'    inputs: []    options:      cache: false
```

And that's it, but there are a few caveats to be aware of...

## Caveats[​](#caveats)

### Greedy inputs[​](#greedy-inputs)

warning

In moon v1.24, root-level tasks default to no inputs. In previous versions, inputs defaulted to
`**/*`. This section is only applicable for older moon versions!

Task [`inputs`](/docs/config/project#inputs) default to `**/*`, which would result in root-level tasks
scanning all files in the repository. This will be a very expensive operation! We suggest
restricting inputs to a very succinct whitelist, or disabling inputs entirely.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  oneOff:    # ...    inputs: []
```

### Inherited tasks[​](#inherited-tasks)

Because a root project is still a project in the workspace, it will inherit all tasks defined in
[`.moon/tasks/all.yml`](/docs/config/tasks), which may be unexpected. To mitigate this, you can exclude
some or all of these tasks in the root config with
[`workspace.inheritedTasks`](/docs/config/project#inheritedtasks).

moon.yml

```
workspace:  inheritedTasks:    include: []
```
