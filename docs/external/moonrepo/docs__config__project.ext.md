# moon

The `moon.yml` configuration file is not required but can be used to define additional metadata
for a project, override inherited tasks, and more at the project-level. When used, this file must
exist in a project's root, as configured in [`projects`](/docs/config/workspace#projects).

## `dependsOn`[​](#dependson)

Explicitly defines other projects that this project depends on, primarily when generating the
project and task graphs. The most common use case for this is building those projects before
building this one. When defined, this setting requires an array of project names, which are the keys
found in the [`projects`](/docs/config/workspace#projects) map.

moon.yml

```
dependsOn:  - 'apiClients'  - 'designSystem'
```

A dependency object can also be defined, where a specific `scope` can be assigned, which accepts
"production" (default), "development", "build", or "peer".

moon.yml

```
dependsOn:  - id: 'apiClients'    scope: 'production'  - id: 'designSystem'    scope: 'peer'
```

Learn more about [implicit and explicit dependencies](/docs/concepts/project#dependencies).

## Metadata[​](#metadata)

## `id`v1.18.0[​](#id)

Overrides the name (identifier) of the project, which was configured in or derived from the
[`projects`](/docs/config/workspace#projects) setting in [`.moon/workspace.yml`](/docs/config/workspace). This setting is
useful when using glob based project location, and want to avoid using the folder name as the
project name.

moon.yml

```
id: 'custom-id'
```

info

All references to the project must use the new identifier, including project and task dependencies.

## `language`[​](#language)

The primary programming language the project is written in. This setting is required for
[task inheritance](/docs/config/tasks), editor extensions, and more. Supports the following values:

- `bash` - A [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) based project (Unix only).

- `batch` - A [Batch](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Batch_Scripting)/PowerShell based project (Windows only).

- `go` - A [Go](https://go.dev/) based project.

- `javascript` - A [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) based project.

- `php` - A [PHP](https://www.php.net) based project.

- `python` - A [Python](https://www.python.org/) based project.

- `ruby` - A [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) based project.

- `rust` - A [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) based project.

- `typescript` - A [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) based project.

- `unknown` (default) - When not configured or inferred.

- `*` - A custom language. Values will be converted to kebab-case.

moon.yml

```
language: 'javascript'# Customlanguage: 'kotlin'
```

For convenience, when this setting is not defined, moon will attempt to detect the language based
on configuration files found in the project root. This only applies to non-custom languages!

## `owners`v1.8.0[​](#owners)

Defines ownership of source code within the current project, by mapping file system paths to owners.
An owner is either a user, team, or group.

Currently supports
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners),
[GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/reference.html), and
[Bitbucket](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218598/code-owners-for-bitbucket?tab=overview&hosting=cloud)
(via app).

### `customGroups`Bitbucket[​](#customgroups)

When using the
[Code Owners for Bitbucket](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218598/code-owners-for-bitbucket?tab=overview&hosting=cloud)
app, this setting provides a way to define custom groups that will be injected at the top of the
`CODEOWNERS` file. These groups must be unique across all projects.

moon.yml

```
owners:  customGroups:    '@@@backend': ['@"user name"', '@@team']
```

### `defaultOwner`[​](#defaultowner)

The default owner for all [`paths`](#paths). This setting is optional in some cases but helps to
avoid unnecessary repetition.

moon.yml

```
owners:  defaultOwner: '@frontend'
```

### `optional`GitLab[​](#optional)

For GitLab, marks the project's
[code owners section](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/reference.html#optional-sections)
as optional. Defaults to `false`.

moon.yml

```
owners:  optional: true
```

### `paths`[​](#paths)

The primary setting for defining ownership of source code within the current project. This setting
supports 2 formats, the first being a list of file paths relative from the current project. This
format requires [`defaultOwner`](#defaultowner) to be defined, and only supports 1 owner for every
path (the default owner).

moon.yml

```
owners:  defaultOwner: '@frontend'  paths:    - '**/*.ts'    - '**/*.tsx'    - '*.config.js'
```

The second format provides far more granularity, allowing for multiple owners per path. This format
requires a map, where the key is a file path relative from the current project, and the value is a
list of owners. Paths with an empty list of owners will fallback to [`defaultOwner`](#defaultowner).

moon.yml

```
owners:  defaultOwner: '@frontend'  paths:    '**/*.rs': ['@backend']    '**/*.js': []    '*.config.js': ['@frontend', '@frontend-infra']
```

The syntax for owners is dependent on the provider you are using for version control (GitHub,
GitLab, Bitbucket). moon provides no validation or guarantees that these are correct.

### `requiredApprovals`Bitbucket / GitLab[​](#requiredapprovals)

Requires a specific number of approvals for a pull/merge request to be satisfied. Defaults to `1`.

- For Bitbucket, defines the [`Check()` condition](https://docs.mibexsoftware.com/codeowners/merge-checks#MergeChecks-2.MergeChecks:HowmanyoftheseCodeOwnersneedtoapprovebeforeapullrequestcanbemerged?) when using a [`defaultOwner`](#defaultowner).

- For GitLab, defines a requirement on the [code owners section](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/reference.html#sections-requiring-multiple-approvals).

moon.yml

```
owners:  requiredApprovals: 2
```

## `layer`[​](#layer)

The layer within a [stack](#stack). Supports the following values:

- `application` - An application of any kind.

- `automation` - An automated testing suite, like E2E, integration, or visual tests. v1.16.0

- `configuration` - Configuration files or infrastructure. v1.22.0

- `library` - A self-contained, shareable, and publishable set of code.

- `scaffolding` - Templates or generators for scaffolding. v1.22.0

- `tool` - An internal tool, CLI, one-off script, etc.

- `unknown` (default) - When not configured.

moon.yml

```
layer: 'application'
```

info

The project layer is used in [task inheritance](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance),
[constraints and boundaries](/docs/config/workspace#constraints), editor extensions, and more!

## `project`[​](#project)

The `project` setting defines metadata about the project itself.

moon.yml

```
project:  title: 'moon'  description: 'A monorepo management tool.'  channel: '#moon'  owner: 'infra.platform'  maintainers: ['miles.johnson']
```

The information listed within `project` is purely informational and primarily displayed within the
CLI. However, this setting exists for you, your team, and your company, as a means to identify and
organize all projects. Feel free to build your own tooling around these settings!

### `channel`[​](#channel)

The Slack, Discord, Teams, IRC, etc channel name (with leading #) in which to discuss the project.

### `description`Required[​](#description)

A description of what the project does and aims to achieve. Be as descriptive as possible, as this
is the kind of information search engines would index on.

### `maintainers`[​](#maintainers)

A list of people/developers that maintain the project, review code changes, and can provide support.
Can be a name, email, LDAP name, GitHub username, etc, the choice is yours.

### `title`[​](#title)

A human readable name of the project. This is different from the unique project name configured in
[`projects`](/docs/config/workspace#projects).

### `owner`[​](#owner)

The team or organization that owns the project. Can be a title, LDAP name, GitHub team, etc. We
suggest not listing people/developers as the owner, use [maintainers](#maintainers) instead.

### Custom fieldsv2.0.0[​](#custom-fields)

Additional fields can be configured as custom metadata to associate to this project. Supports all
value types that are valid JSON.

moon.yml

```
project:  # ...  deprecated: true
```

## `stack`v1.22.0[​](#stack)

The technology stack this project belongs to, primarily for categorization. Supports the following
values:

- `backend` - Server-side APIs, etc.

- `data` - Data sources, database layers, etc. v2.0.0

- `frontend` - Client-side user interfaces, etc.

- `infrastructure` - Cloud/server infrastructure, Docker, etc.

- `systems` - Low-level systems programming.

- `unknown` (default) - When not configured.

moon.yml

```
stack: 'frontend'
```

info

The project stack is also used in [constraints and boundaries](/docs/config/workspace#constraints)!

## `tags`[​](#tags)

Tags are a simple mechanism for categorizing projects. They can be used to group projects together
for [easier querying](/docs/commands/query/projects), enforcing of
[project boundaries and constraints](/docs/config/workspace#constraints),
[task inheritance](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance), and more.

moon.yml

```
tags:  - 'react'  - 'prisma'
```

## Integrations[​](#integrations)

## `docker`v1.27.0[​](#docker)

Configures Docker integration for the current project.

### `file`[​](#file)

Configures the `Dockerfile` generation process when [`moon docker file`](/docs/commands/docker/file) is
executed.

#### `buildTask`[​](#buildtask)

The name of a task within the current project that will be used for building the project before
running it. If not defined, does nothing.

moon.yml

```
docker:  file:    buildTask: 'build'
```

#### `image`[​](#image)

The Docker image to use in the base stage. Defaults to an image based on the project's toolchain, as
outlined below.

- `oven/bun:latest` for Bun

- `denoland/deno:latest` for Deno

- `node:latest` for Node.js

- `python:latest` for Python

- `rust:latest` for Rust

- `scratch` for everything else

moon.yml

```
docker:  file:    image: 'node:latest'
```

#### `startTask`[​](#starttask)

The name of a task within the current project that will run the project after it has been built (if
required). This task will be used as `CMD` within the `Dockerfile`.

moon.yml

```
docker:  file:    startTask: 'start'
```

### `scaffold`[​](#scaffold)

Configures aspects of the Docker scaffolding process when
[`moon docker scaffold`](/docs/commands/docker/scaffold) is executed. Only applies to the
[sources skeleton](/docs/commands/docker/scaffold#sources).

#### `sourcesPhaseGlobs`[​](#sourcesphaseglobs)

List of globs in which to copy project-relative files into the `.moon/docker/sources` skeleton. When
not defined, defaults to `**/*`.

moon.yml

```
docker:  scaffold:    sourcesPhaseGlobs:      - 'src/**/*'
```

## Tasks[​](#tasks)

## `env`[​](#env)

The `env` field is map of strings that are passed as environment variables to all tasks within the
current project. Project-level variables will not override task-level variables of the same name.

moon.yml

```
env:  NODE_ENV: 'production'
```

View the task [`env`](#env-1) setting for more usage examples and information.

## `fileGroups`[​](#filegroups)

Defines [file groups](/docs/concepts/file-group) to be used by local tasks. By default, this setting
is not required for the following reasons:

- File groups are an optional feature, and are designed for advanced use cases.

- File groups defined in [`.moon/tasks/all.yml`](/docs/config/tasks) will be inherited by all projects.

When defined this setting requires a map, where the key is the file group name, and the value is a
list of [globs or file paths](/docs/concepts/file-pattern), or environment variables. Globs and paths
are [relative to a project](/docs/concepts/file-pattern#project-relative) (even when defined
[globally](/docs/config/tasks)).

moon.yml

```
# Example groupsfileGroups:  configs:    - '*.config.{js,cjs,mjs}'    - '*.json'  sources:    - 'src/**/*'    - 'types/**/*'  tests:    - 'tests/**/*'    - '**/__tests__/**/*'  assets:    - 'assets/**/*'    - 'images/**/*'    - 'static/**/*'    - '**/*.{scss,css}'
```

Once your groups have been defined, you can reference them within [`args`](#args),
[`inputs`](#inputs), [`outputs`](#outputs), and more, using
[token functions and variables](/docs/concepts/token).

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    command: 'vite build'    inputs:      - '@group(configs)'      - '@group(sources)'
```

## `tasks`[​](#tasks-1)

Tasks are actions that are ran within the context of a [project](/docs/concepts/project), and commonly
wrap an npm binary or system command. This setting requires a map, where the key is a unique name
for the task, and the value is an object of task parameters.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  format:    command: 'prettier'  lint:    command: 'eslint'  test:    command: 'jest'  typecheck:    command: 'tsc'
```

### `extends`v1.12.0[​](#extends)

The `extends` field can be used to extend the settings from a sibling task within the same project,
or [inherited from the global scope](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance). This is useful for composing
similar tasks with different arguments or options.

When extending another task, the same
[merge strategies](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) used for inheritance are applied.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  lint:    command: 'eslint .'    inputs:      - 'src/**/*'  lint-fix:    extends: 'lint'    args: '--fix'    preset: 'utility'
```

### `description`v1.22.0[​](#description-1)

A human-readable description of what the task does. This information is displayed within the
[`moon project`](/docs/commands/project) and [`moon task`](/docs/commands/task) commands.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    description: 'Builds the project using Vite'    command: 'vite build'
```

### `command`[​](#command)

The `command` field is a single command to execute for the task, including the command binary/name
(must be first) and any optional [arguments](#args). This field supports task inheritance and
merging of arguments.

This setting can be defined using a string, or an array of strings. We suggest using arrays when
dealing with many args, or the args string cannot be parsed easily.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  format:    # Using a string    command: 'prettier --check .'    # Using an array    command:      - 'prettier'      - '--check'      - '.'
```

info

If you need to support pipes, redirects, or multiple commands, use [`script`](#script) instead.
Learn more about [commands vs scripts](/docs/concepts/task#commands-vs-scripts).

#### Special commands[​](#special-commands)

For interoperability reasons, the following command names have special handling.

- `noop`, `no-op`, `nop` - Marks the task as a "no operation". Will not execute a command in the action pipeline but can define dependencies.

- When `toolchain` is "bun": `bun`, `bunx` - Uses the binaries from the toolchain.

- When `toolchain` is "deno": Will execute with `deno` binary.

- When `toolchain` is "node": `node`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn` - Uses the binaries from the toolchain.

- When `toolchain` is "rust": Will execute with `cargo` binary.

### `args`[​](#args)

The `args` field is a collection of additional arguments to append to the [`command`](#command)
when executing the task. This field exists purely to provide arguments for
[inherited tasks](/docs/config/tasks#tasks).

This setting can be defined using a string, or an array of strings. We suggest using arrays when
dealing with many args, or the args string cannot be parsed easily.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  test:    command: 'jest'    # Using a string    args: '--color --maxWorkers 3'    # Using an array    args:      - '--color'      - '--maxWorkers'      - '3'
```

However, for the array approach to work correctly, each argument must be its own distinct item,
including argument values. For example:

moon.yml

```
tasks:  test:    command: 'jest'    args:      # Valid      - '--maxWorkers'      - '3'      # Also valid      - '--maxWorkers=3'      # Invalid      - '--maxWorkers 3'
```

### `deps`[​](#deps)

The `deps` field is a list of other tasks (known as [targets](/docs/concepts/target)), either within
this project or found in another project, that will be executed before this task. It achieves this
by generating a directed task graph based on the project graph.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    command: 'webpack'    deps:      - 'apiClients:build'      - 'designSystem:build'      # A task within the current project      - 'codegen'
```

#### Args & env[​](#args--env)

Furthermore, for each dependency target, you can configure additional command line arguments and
environment variables that'll be passed to the dependent task when it is ran. The `args` field
supports a list of strings, while `env` is an object of key-value pairs.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    command: 'webpack'    deps:      - target: 'apiClients:build'        args: ['--env', 'production']        env:          NODE_ENV: 'production'
```

Dependencies of inherited tasks will be excluded and renamed according to the
[`workspace.inheritedTasks`](#inheritedtasks) setting. This process only uses filters from the
current project, and not filters from dependent projects. Furthermore, `args` and `env` are not
deeply merged.

#### Optional[​](#optional-1)

By default, all dependencies are required to exist when tasks are being built and expanded, but this
isn't always true when dealing with composition and inheritance. For dependencies that may not exist
based on what's inherited, you can mark it as `optional`.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    command: 'webpack'    deps:      - target: 'apiClients:build'        optional: true
```

### `env`[​](#env-1)

The `env` field is map of strings that are passed as environment variables when running the command.
Variables defined here will take precedence over those loaded with [`envFile`](#envfile).

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    command: 'webpack'    env:      NODE_ENV: 'production'
```

Variables also support substitution using the syntax `${VAR_NAME}`. When using substitution, only
variables in the current process can be referenced, and not those currently defined in `env`.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    command: 'webpack'    env:      APP_TARGET: '${REGION}-${ENVIRONMENT}'
```

### `inputs`[​](#inputs)

The `inputs` field is a list of sources that calculate whether to execute this task based on the
environment and files that have been touched since the last time the task has been ran. If not
defined or inherited, then all files within a project are considered an input (`**/*`), excluding
root-level tasks.

Inputs support the following source types:

- Environment variables

- Environment variable wildcards v1.22.0

- Files, folders, and globs

- [Token functions and variables](/docs/concepts/token)

moon.yml

```
tasks:  lint:    command: 'eslint'    inputs:      # Config files anywhere within the project      - '**/.eslintignore'      - '**/.eslintrc.js'      # Config files at the workspace root      - '/.eslintignore'      - '/.eslintrc.js'      # Tokens      - '$projectRoot'      - '@group(sources)'
```

#### Environment variables[​](#environment-variables)

Environment variables can be used as inputs and must start with a `$`. Wildcard variables can use
`*` to match any character.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  example:    inputs:      - '$FOO_CACHE'      - '$FOO_*'
```

caution

When using an environment variable, we assume it's not defined by default, and will trigger an
affected state when it is defined. If the environment variable always exists, then the task will
always run and bypass the cache.

#### File paths[​](#file-paths)

File paths support
[project and workspace relative file/folder patterns](/docs/concepts/file-pattern#project-relative).
They can be defined as a literal path, or a `file://` URI v1.39.0,
or as an object with a `file` property v1.39.0. Additionally, the
following parameters are supported as a URI query or as object fields:

- `content`, `match`, `matches` (`string`) - When determining affected state, will match against the file's content using the defined regex pattern, instead of relying on file existence.

- `optional` (`boolean`) - When hashing and set to `true` and the file is missing, will not log a warning. When set to `false` and the file is missing, will fail with an error. Defaults to logging a warning.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  example:    inputs:      # Literal paths      - 'project/relative/file.js'      - '/workspace/relative/file.js'      # Using file protocol      - 'file://project/relative/file.js?optional'      - 'file:///workspace/relative/file.js?content=a|b|c'      # Using an object      - file: 'project/relative/file.js'        optional: true      - file: '/workspace/relative/file.js'        content: 'a|b|c'
```

#### File groupsv1.41.0[​](#file-groups)

A file group input will reference the defined files/globs within from a file group in the current
project. It can be defined with a `group://` URI, or as an object with a `group` property.
Additionally, the following parameters are supported as a URI query or as object fields:

- `format`, `as` (`string`) - The format in which to gather the file group results. Supported values are `static` (default), `files`, `dirs`, `globs`, `envs`, and `root`.

moon.yml

```
fileGroups:  sources:    - 'src/**/*'tasks:  build:    # ...    inputs:      # Using group protocol      - 'group://sources?format=dirs'      # Using an object      - group: 'sources'        format: 'dirs'
```

#### Glob patterns[​](#glob-patterns)

Glob patterns support
[project and workspace relative file/folder patterns](/docs/concepts/file-pattern#project-relative).
They can be defined as a literal path, or a `glob://` URI v1.39.0,
or as an object with a `glob` property v1.39.0. Additionally, the
following parameters are supported as a URI query or as object fields:

- `cache` (`boolean`) - When gathering inputs for hashing, defines whether the glob results should be cached for the duration of the moon process. Defaults to `true`.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  example:    inputs:      # Literal paths      - 'project/relative/file.*'      - '/workspace/relative/**/*'      # Using glob protocol      - 'glob://project/relative/file.*?cache=false'      - 'glob:///workspace/relative/**/*?cache'      # Using an object      - glob: 'project/relative/file.*'        cache: false      - glob: '/workspace/relative/**/*'
```

Globs can also be negated by prefixing the path with `!`, which will exclude all files that match
the glob.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  example:    inputs:      - '!**/*.md'      - 'glob://!/workspace/relative/**/*'      - glob: '!/workspace/relative/**/*'
```

warning

Glob patterns that contain `?`, for example `*.tsx?`, cannot be used in URI format, as it conflicts
with the query string syntax. Use the path or object format instead.

danger

Be aware that files that match the glob, but are ignored via `.gitignore` (or similar), will not
be considered an input. To work around this, use explicit file inputs.

#### External projectsv1.41.0[​](#external-projects)

Tasks can also depend on files and globs from other projects within the same workspace. This is
useful for handling cross-project relationships without needing to define explicit task
dependencies.

External projects can be defined as a `project://` URI, or as an object with a `project` property,
both of which require a project identifier, or `^` for all dependent projects. Additionally, the
following parameters are supported as a URI query or as object fields:

- `group`, `fileGroup` (`id`) - The name of a file group within the external project in which file and glob patterns will be used for matching. Takes precedence over `filter`.

- `filter` (`string[]`) - A list of [project relative glob patterns](/docs/concepts/file-pattern#project-relative) that will be used for matching.

If neither `group` nor `filter` are defined, all files within the external project are considered a
match (`**/*`).

moon.yml

```
tasks:  example:    inputs:      # Using project protocol      - 'project://foo'      - 'project://bar?group=sources'      - 'project://baz?filter=src/**/*'      # Using an object      - project: 'foo'      - project: 'bar'        group: 'sources'      - project: 'baz'        filter: ['src/**/*']
```

### `outputs`[​](#outputs)

The `outputs` field is a list of [files and folders](/docs/concepts/file-pattern#project-relative) that
are created as a result of executing this task, typically from a build or compilation related
task. Outputs are necessary for [incremental caching and hydration](/docs/concepts/cache). If you'd
prefer to avoid that functionality, omit this field.

#### File paths[​](#file-paths-1)

File paths support
[project and workspace relative file/folder patterns](/docs/concepts/file-pattern#project-relative).
They can be defined as a literal path, or a `file://` URI v1.41.0,
or as an object with a `file` property v1.41.0. Additionally, the
following parameters are supported as a URI query or as object fields:

- `optional` (`boolean`) - When archiving and set to `true` and the file is missing, will not fail with a missing output error. Defaults to `false`.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  example:    inputs:      # Literal paths      - 'build/'      # Using file protocol      - 'file://build/'      # Using an object      - file: 'build/'        optional: true
```

#### Glob patterns[​](#glob-patterns-1)

Glob patterns support
[project and workspace relative file/folder patterns](/docs/concepts/file-pattern#project-relative).
They can be defined as a literal path, or a `glob://` URI v1.41.0,
or as an object with a `glob` property v1.41.0. Additionally, the
following parameters are supported as a URI query or as object fields:

- `optional` (`boolean`) - When archiving and set to `true` and the glob produced no results, will not fail with a missing output error. Defaults to `false`.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  example:    inputs:      # Literal paths      - 'build/**/*.js'      - '!build/internal.js'      # Using glob protocol      - 'glob://build/**/*.js'      # Using an object      - glob: 'build/**/*.js'
```

warning

Glob patterns that contain `?`, for example `*.tsx?`, cannot be used in URI format, as it conflicts
with the query string syntax. Use the path or object format instead.

danger

When using globs and moon hydrates an output (a cache hit), all files not matching the glob will be
deleted. Ensure that all files critical for the build to function correctly are included.

### `preset`v1.28.0[​](#preset)

Applies the chosen preset to the task. A preset defines a collection of task options that will be
inherited as the default, and can then be overridden within the task itself. The following presets
are available:

- `server` [`cache`](#cache) -> Turned off

- [`outputStyle`](#outputstyle) -> Set to "stream"

- [`persistent`](#persistent) -> Turned on

- [`runInCI`](#runinci) -> Turned off

- `utility` v2.0.0 [`cache`](#cache) -> Turned off

- [`interactive`](#interactive) -> Turned on

- [`outputStyle`](#outputstyle) -> Set to "stream"

- [`persistent`](#persistent) -> Turned off

- [`runInCI`](#runinci) -> Skipped

Tasks named "dev", "start", or "serve" are marked as `server` automatically.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  dev:    command: 'webpack server'    preset: 'server'
```

### `script`v1.27.0[​](#script)

The `script` field is one or many commands to execute for the task, with support for pipes,
redirects, and more. This field does not support task inheritance merging, and can only be defined
with a string.

If defined, will supersede [`command`](#command) and [`args`](#args).

moon.yml

```
tasks:  exec:    # Single command    script: 'cp ./in ./out'    # Multiple commands    script: 'rm -rf ./out && cp ./in ./out'    # Pipes    script: 'ps aux | grep 3000'    # Redirects    script: './gen.sh > out.json'
```

info

If you need to support merging during task inheritance, use [`command`](#command) instead. Learn
more about [commands vs scripts](/docs/concepts/task#commands-vs-scripts).

### `toolchains`v1.31.0[​](#toolchains)

The `toolchain` field defines additional [toolchain(s)](/docs/concepts/toolchain) the command runs on,
where to locate its executable, and more. By default, moon will set to a value based on the
project's [`language`](#language), default [`toolchain.default`](#toolchain-1), or via detection.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  env:    command: 'printenv'    toolchains: 'system'
```

This setting also supports multiple values.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    command: 'npm run build'    toolchains: ['javascript', 'node', 'npm']
```

### `options`[​](#options)

The `options` field is an object of configurable options that can be used to modify the task and its
execution. The following fields can be provided, with merge related fields supporting all
[merge strategies](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies).

moon.yml

```
tasks:  typecheck:    command: 'tsc --noEmit'    options:      mergeArgs: 'replace'      runFromWorkspaceRoot: true
```

#### `affectedFiles`[​](#affectedfiles)

When enabled and the [`--affected` option](/docs/run-task#running-based-on-affected-files-only) is
provided, all affected files that match this task's [`inputs`](#inputs) will be passed as relative
file paths as command line arguments, and as a `MOON_AFFECTED_FILES` environment variable.

If there are no affected files, `.` (current directory) will be passed instead for arguments, and an
empty value for the environment variable. This functionality can be changed with the
[`affectedPassInputs`](#affectedpassinputs) setting.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  lint:    command: 'eslint'    options:      affectedFiles: true      # Only pass args      affectedFiles: 'args'      # Only set env var      affectedFiles: 'env'
```

caution

When using this option, ensure that explicit files or `.` are not present in the [`args`](#args)
list. Furthermore, this functionality will only work if the task's command supports an arbitrary
list of files being passed as arguments.

This setting also supports an object format with additional parameters. The `pass` field is
required, which accepts a value described above.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  lint:    command: 'eslint'    options:      affectedFiles:        pass: 'args'
```

The following additional parameters are supported:

- `passInputsWhenNoMatch` (`boolean`) - When no affected files are found, and `pass` includes `args`, will pass all configured [`inputs`](#inputs) as relative file paths instead of `.`. Defaults to `false`.

#### `allowFailure`v1.13.0[​](#allowfailure)

Allows a task to fail without failing the entire pipeline. When enabled, the following changes
occur:

- Other tasks cannot depend on this task, as we can't ensure it's side-effect free.

- For [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run), the process will not bail early and will run to completion.

- For [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci), the process will not exit with a non-zero exit code, if the only failing tasks are allowed to fail.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  lint:    command: 'eslint'    options:      allowFailure: true
```

#### `cache`[​](#cache)

Whether to cache the task's execution result using our [smart hashing](/docs/concepts/cache#hashing)
system. If disabled, will not create a cache hash, and will not persist a task's
[outputs](#outputs). Supports the following values:

- `true` (default) - Cache the task's output.

- `false` - Do not cache the task's output.

- `local` - Only cache locally. v1.40.0

- `remote` - Only cache [remotely](/docs/guides/remote-cache). v1.40.0

We suggest disabling caching when defining cleanup tasks, one-off scripts, or file system heavy
operations.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  clean:    command: 'rm -rf ./temp'    options:      cache: false
```

#### `cacheKey`v1.35.0[​](#cachekey)

A custom key to include in the cache and task hashing process. Can be used to invalidate local and
remote caches.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    command: 'some-costly-build'    options:      cacheKey: 'v1'
```

#### `cacheLifetime`v1.29.0[​](#cachelifetime)

The lifetime in which a [cached task](#cache) will live before being marked as stale and re-running.
This applies to a task even if it does not produce [outputs](#outputs).

The lifetime can be configured in a human-readable string format, for example, `1 day`, `3 hr`,
`1m`, etc. If the lifetime is not defined, the cache will live forever, or until the task inputs are
touched.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    command: 'some-costly-build'    options:      cacheLifetime: '1 day'
```

String formats are powered by the
[humantime](https://docs.rs/humantime/2.1.0/humantime/fn.parse_duration.html) crate.

#### `envFile`[​](#envfile)

A boolean or path to a `.env` file (also know as dotenv file) that defines a collection of
[environment variables](#env-1) for the current task. Variables will be loaded on project creation,
but will not override those defined in [`env`](#env-1).

Variables defined in the file support value substitution/expansion by wrapping the variable name in
curly brackets, such as `${VAR_NAME}`.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    command: 'webpack'    options:      # Defaults to .env      envFile: true      # Or      envFile: '.env.production'      # Or from the workspace root      envFile: '/.env.shared'
```

When set to `true`, moon will load the following files in order, with later files taking precedence
over earlier ones:

- `/.env`

- `/.env.local`

- `.env`

- `.env.local`

- `.env.`

- `.env..local`

Additionally, a list of file paths can also be provided. When using a list, the order of the files
is important, as environment variables from all files will be aggregated into a single map, with
subsequent files taking precedence over previous ones. Once aggregated, the variables will be passed
to the task, but will not override those defined in [`env`](#env-1).

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    command: 'webpack'    options:      envFile:        - '.env'        - '.env.production'
```

#### `inferInputs`v1.31.0[​](#inferinputs)

Automatically infer [inputs](#inputs) based on the following parameters configured within the task's
`command`, `script`, `args`, or `env`. Defaults to `false`.

- File/glob paths derived from [file group based token functions](/docs/concepts/token#file-groups).

- Environment variables being substituted within a command or script.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    # ...    options:      inferInputs: false
```

#### `internal`v1.23.0[​](#internal)

Marks the task as internal only. [Internal tasks](/docs/concepts/task#internal-only) can not be
explicitly ran on the command line, but can be depended on by other tasks.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  prepare:    # ...    options:      internal: true
```

#### `interactive`v1.12.0[​](#interactive)

Marks the task as interactive. [Interactive tasks](/docs/concepts/task#interactive) run in isolation so
that they can interact with stdin.

This setting also disables caching, turns of CI, and other functionality, similar to the
[`preset`](#preset) setting.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  init:    # ...    options:      interactive: true
```

#### `merge`v1.29.0[​](#merge)

The [strategy](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging [`args`](#args),
[`deps`](#deps), [`env`](#env-1), [`inputs`](#inputs), and [`outputs`](#outputs) with an inherited
task. This option can be overridden with the field specific merge options below.

#### `mergeArgs`[​](#mergeargs)

The [strategy](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging the
[`args`](#args) list with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeDeps`[​](#mergedeps)

The [strategy](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging the
[`deps`](#deps) list with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeEnv`[​](#mergeenv)

The [strategy](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging the
[`env`](#env-1) map with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeInputs`[​](#mergeinputs)

The [strategy](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging the
[`inputs`](#inputs) list with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeOutputs`[​](#mergeoutputs)

The [strategy](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging the
[`outputs`](#outputs) list with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mergeToolchains`[​](#mergetoolchains)

The [strategy](/docs/concepts/task-inheritance#merge-strategies) to use when merging the
[`toolchains`](#toolchains) list with an inherited task. Defaults to "append".

#### `mutex`v1.24.0[​](#mutex)

Creates an exclusive lock on a "virtual resource", preventing other tasks using the same "virtual
resource" from running concurrently.

If you have many tasks that require exclusive access to a resource that can't be tracked by moon
(like a database, an ignored file, a file that's not part of the project, or a remote resource) you
can use the `mutex` option to prevent them from running at the same time.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  a:    # ...    options:      mutex: 'virtual_resource_name'  # b doesn't necessarily have to be in the same project  b:    # ...    options:      mutex: 'virtual_resource_name'
```

#### `os`v1.28.0[​](#os)

When defined, the task will only run on the configured operating system. For other operating
systems, the task becomes a no-operation. Supports the values `linux`, `macos`, and `windows`.

Can be defined as a single value, or a list of values.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build-unix:    # ...    options:      os: ['linux', 'macos']  build-windows:    # ...    options:      os: 'windows'
```

#### `outputStyle`[​](#outputstyle)

Controls how stdout/stderr is displayed when the task is ran as a transitive target. By default,
this setting is not defined and defers to the action pipeline, but can be overridden with one of the
following values:

- `buffer` - Buffers output and displays after the task has exited (either success or failure).

- `buffer-only-failure` - Like `buffer`, but only displays on failures.

- `hash` - Ignores output and only displays the generated [hash](/docs/concepts/cache#hashing).

- `none` - Ignores output.

- `stream` - Streams output directly to the terminal. Will prefix each line of output with the target.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  test:    # ...    options:      outputStyle: 'stream'
```

#### `persistent`v1.6.0[​](#persistent)

Marks the task as persistent (continuously running). [Persistent tasks](/docs/concepts/task#persistent)
are handled differently than non-persistent tasks in the action graph. When running a target, all
persistent tasks are ran last and in parallel, after all their dependencies have completed.

This is extremely useful for running a server (or a watcher) in the background while other tasks are
running.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  dev:    # ...    options:      persistent: true
```

We suggest using the [`preset`](#preset) setting instead, which enables this setting, amongst
other useful settings.

#### `priority`v1.35.0[​](#priority)

The priority level determines the position of the task within the action pipeline queue. A task with
a higher priority will run sooner rather than later, while still respecting the topological order.
Supports the following levels:

- `critical`

- `high`

- `normal` (default)

- `low`

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    # ...    options:      priority: 'high'
```

#### `retryCount`[​](#retrycount)

The number of attempts the task will retry execution before returning a failure. This is especially
useful for flaky tasks. Defaults to `0`.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  test:    # ...    options:      retryCount: 3
```

#### `runDepsInParallel`[​](#rundepsinparallel)

Whether to run the task's direct [`deps`](#deps) in parallel or serial (in order). Defaults to
`true`.

When disabled, this does not run dependencies of dependencies in serial, only direct dependencies.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  start:    # ...    deps:      - '~:clean'      - '~:build'    options:      runDepsInParallel: false
```

#### `runInCI`[​](#runinci)

Whether to run the task automatically in a CI (continuous integration) environment when affected by
touched files using the [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci) command. Supports the following values:

- `always` - Always run in CI, regardless if affected or not. v1.31.0

- `affected`, `true` (default) - Only run in CI if affected by touched files.

- `false` - Never run in CI.

- `only` - Only run in CI, and not locally, if affected by touched files. v1.41.0

- `skip` - Skip running in CI but run locally and allow task relationships to be valid. v1.41.0

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    # ...    options:      runInCI: false
```

#### `runFromWorkspaceRoot`[​](#runfromworkspaceroot)

Whether to use the workspace root as the working directory when executing a task. Defaults to
`false` and runs from the task's project root.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  typecheck:    # ...    options:      runFromWorkspaceRoot: true
```

#### `shell`[​](#shell)

Whether to run the command within a shell or not. Defaults to `true` for system toolchain or
Windows, and `false` otherwise. The shell to run is determined by the [`unixShell`](#unixshell) and
[`windowsShell`](#windowsshell) options respectively.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  native:    command: 'echo $SHELL'    options:      shell: true
```

However, if you'd like to use a different shell, or customize the shell's arguments, or have
granular control, you can set `shell` to false and configure a fully qualified command.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  native:    command: '/bin/zsh -c "echo $SHELL"'    options:      shell: false
```

#### `timeout`v1.26.0[​](#timeout)

The maximum time in seconds that the task is allowed to run, before it is force cancelled. If not
defined, will run indefinitely.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  build:    # ...    options:      timeout: 120
```

#### `unixShell`v1.21.0[​](#unixshell)

Customize the shell to run with when on a Unix operating system. Accepts `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`,
`ion`, `murex`, `nu`, `pwsh`, `xonsh`, or `zsh`. If not defined, will derive the shell from the
`SHELL` environment variable, or defaults to `bash`.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  native:    command: 'echo $SHELL'    options:      unixShell: 'fish'
```

#### `windowsShell`v1.21.0[​](#windowsshell)

Customize the shell to run with when on a Windows operating system. Accepts `bash` (typically via
Git), `elvish`, `fish`, `murex`, `nu`, `pwsh`, or `xonsh`. If not defined, defaults to `pwsh`.

moon.yml

```
tasks:  native:    command: 'echo $SHELL'    options:      windowsShell: 'bash'
```

## Overrides[​](#overrides)

Dictates how a project interacts with settings defined at the top-level.

## `toolchains`[​](#toolchains-1)

### `default`v1.31.0[​](#default)

The default [`toolchain`](#toolchain-1) for all task's within the current project. When a task's
`toolchain` has not been explicitly configured, the toolchain will fallback to this configured
value, otherwise the toolchain will be detected from the project's environment.

moon.yml

```
toolchains:  default: 'node'
```

### `bun`[​](#bun)

Configures Bun for this project and overrides the top-level [`bun`](/docs/config/toolchain#bun) setting.

#### `version`[​](#version)

Defines the explicit Bun [version specification](/docs/concepts/toolchain#version-specification) to use
when running tasks for this project.

moon.yml

```
toolchains:  bun:    version: '1.0.0'
```

### `deno`[​](#deno)

Configures Deno for this project and overrides the top-level [`deno`](/docs/config/toolchain#deno) setting.

#### `version`[​](#version-1)

Defines the explicit Deno [version specification](/docs/concepts/toolchain#version-specification) to
use when running tasks for this project.

moon.yml

```
toolchains:  deno:    version: '1.40.0'
```

### `node`[​](#node)

Configures Node.js for this project and overrides the top-level [`node`](/docs/config/toolchain#node) setting.
Currently, only the Node.js version can be overridden per-project, not the package manager.

#### `version`[​](#version-2)

Defines the explicit Node.js [version specification](/docs/concepts/toolchain#version-specification) to
use when running tasks for this project.

moon.yml

```
toolchains:  node:    version: '12.12.0'
```

### `python`[​](#python)

Configures Python for this project and overrides the top-level [`python`](/docs/config/toolchain#python)
setting.

#### `version`[​](#version-3)

Defines the explicit Python
[version/channel specification](/docs/concepts/toolchain#version-specification) to use when running
tasks for this project.

moon.yml

```
toolchains:  python:    version: '3.12.0'
```

### `rust`[​](#rust)

Configures Rust for this project and overrides the top-level [`rust`](/docs/config/toolchain#rust) setting.

#### `version`[​](#version-4)

Defines the explicit Rust
[version/channel specification](/docs/concepts/toolchain#version-specification) to use when running
tasks for this project.

moon.yml

```
toolchains:  rust:    version: '1.68.0'
```

### `typescript`[​](#typescript)

#### `includeProjectReferenceSources`v1.17.0[​](#includeprojectreferencesources)

Overrides the workspace-level
[`includeProjectReferenceSources`](/docs/config/toolchain#includeprojectreferencesources) setting. Defaults to
undefined.

moon.yml

```
toolchains:  typescript:    includeProjectReferenceSources: false
```

#### `includeSharedTypes`v1.17.0[​](#includesharedtypes)

Overrides the workspace-level [`includeSharedTypes`](/docs/config/toolchain#includesharedtypes) setting.
Defaults to undefined.

moon.yml

```
toolchains:  typescript:    includeSharedTypes: false
```

#### `routeOutDirToCache`[​](#routeoutdirtocache)

Overrides the workspace-level [`routeOutDirToCache`](/docs/config/toolchain#routeoutdirtocache) setting.
Defaults to undefined.

moon.yml

```
toolchains:  typescript:    routeOutDirToCache: false
```

#### `syncProjectReferences`[​](#syncprojectreferences)

Overrides the workspace-level [`syncProjectReferences`](/docs/config/toolchain#syncprojectreferences) setting.
Defaults to undefined.

moon.yml

```
toolchains:  typescript:    syncProjectReferences: false
```

#### `syncProjectReferencesToPaths`[​](#syncprojectreferencestopaths)

Overrides the workspace-level
[`syncProjectReferencesToPaths`](/docs/config/toolchain#syncprojectreferencestopaths) setting. Defaults to
undefined.

moon.yml

```
toolchains:  typescript:    syncProjectReferencesToPaths: false
```

## `workspace`[​](#workspace)

### `inheritedTasks`[​](#inheritedtasks)

Provides a layer of control when inheriting tasks from [`.moon/tasks/all.yml`](/docs/config/tasks).

#### `exclude`[​](#exclude)

The optional `exclude` setting permits a project to exclude specific tasks from being inherited. It
accepts a list of strings, where each string is the name of a global task to exclude.

moon.yml

```
workspace:  inheritedTasks:    # Exclude the inherited `test` task for this project    exclude: ['test']
```

Exclusion is applied after inclusion and before renaming.

#### `include`[​](#include)

The optional `include` setting permits a project to only include specific inherited tasks (works
like an allow/white list). It accepts a list of strings, where each string is the name of a global
task to include.

When this field is not defined, the project will inherit all tasks from the global project config.

moon.yml

```
workspace:  inheritedTasks:    # Include *no* tasks (works like a full exclude)    include: []    # Only include the `lint` and `test` tasks for this project    include:      - 'lint'      - 'test'
```

Inclusion is applied before exclusion and renaming.

#### `rename`[​](#rename)

The optional `rename` setting permits a project to rename the inherited task within the current
project. It accepts a map of strings, where the key is the original name (found in the global
project config), and the value is the new name to use.

For example, say we have 2 tasks in the global project config called `buildPackage` and
`buildApplication`, but we only need 1, and since we're an application, we should omit and rename.

moon.yml

```
workspace:  inheritedTasks:    exclude: ['buildPackage']    rename:      buildApplication: 'build'
```

Renaming occurs after inclusion and exclusion.
