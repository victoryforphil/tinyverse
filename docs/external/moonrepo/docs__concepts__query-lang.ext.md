# Query language

v1.3.0

moon supports an integrated query language, known as MQL, that can be used to filter and select
projects from the project graph, using an SQL-like syntax. MQL is primarily used by
[`moon run`](/docs/commands/run) with the `--query` option.

## Syntax[​](#syntax)

### Comparisons[​](#comparisons)

A comparison (also known as an assignment) is an expression that defines a piece of criteria, and is
a building block of a query. This criteria maps a [field](#fields) to a value, with an explicit
comparison operator.

#### Equals, Not equals[​](#equals-not-equals)

The equals (`=`) and not equals (`!=`) comparison operators can be used for exact value matching.

```
projectLayer=library && language!=javascript
```

You can also define a list of values using square bracket syntax, that will match against one of the
values.

```
language=[javascript, typescript]
```

#### Like, Not like[​](#like-not-like)

The like (`~`) and not like (`!~`) comparison operators can be used for wildcard value matching,
using [glob syntax](/docs/concepts/file-pattern#globs).

```
projectSource~packages/* && tag!~*-app
```

Like comparisons can only be used on non-enum fields.

### Conditions[​](#conditions)

The `&&` and `||` logical operators can be used to combine multiple comparisons into a condition.
The `&&` operator is used to combine comparisons into a logical AND, and the `||` operator is used
for logical OR.

```
taskToolchain=system || taskToolchain=node
```

For readability concerns, you can also use `AND` or `OR`.

```
taskToolchain=system OR taskToolchain=node
```

Mixing both operators in the same condition is not supported.

### Grouping[​](#grouping)

For advanced queries and complex conditions, you can group comparisons using parentheses to create
logical groupings. Groups can also be nested within other groups.

```
language=javascript && (taskType=test || taskType=build)
```

## Fields[​](#fields)

The following fields can be used as criteria, and are related to [task tokens](/docs/concepts/token#variables).

### `language`[​](#language)

Programming language the project is written in, as defined in
[`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project#language).

```

```

### `project`[​](#project)

Name OR alias of the project.

```
project=server
```

### `projectAlias`[​](#projectalias)

projectAlias~@scope/*

```
projectLayer=application

### `projectId`[​](#projectid)

Name of the project, as defined in [`.moon/workspace.yml`](/docs/config/workspace), or `id` in
[`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project#id).

```
projectId=server
```

### `projectSource`[​](#projectsource)

Relative file path from the workspace root to the project root, as defined in
[`.moon/workspace.yml`](/docs/config/workspace).

```
projectSource~packages/*
```

### `projectStack`v1.22.0[​](#projectstack)

The project stack, as defined in [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project#stack).

```
projectStack=frontend
```

### `tag`[​](#tag)

A tag within the project, as defined in [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project#tags).

```
tag~react-*
```

### `task`[​](#task)

ID/name of a task within the project.

```
task=[build,test]
```

### `taskToolchain`v1.31.0[​](#tasktoolchain)

The toolchain a task will run against, as defined in [`moon.yml`](/docs/config/project).

```
