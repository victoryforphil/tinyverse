Documentation is currently for [moon v2](/blog/moon-v2-alpha) and latest proto. Documentation for moon v1 has been frozen and can be [found here](https://moonrepo.github.io/website-v1/).

# Task profiling

Troubleshooting slow or unperformant tasks? Profile and diagnose them with ease!

caution

Profiling is only supported by `node` based tasks, and is not supported by tasks that are created
through `package.json` inference, or for packages that ship non-JavaScript code (like Rust or Go).

## CPU snapshots[​](#cpu-snapshots)

CPU profiling helps you get a better understanding of which parts of your code require the most CPU
time, and how your code is executed and optimized by Node.js. The profiler will measure code
execution and activities performed by the engine itself, such as compilation, calls of system
libraries, optimization, and garbage collection.

### Record a profile[​](#record-a-profile)

To record a CPU profile, pass `--profile cpu` to the [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run) command. When
successful, the profile will be written to
`.moon/cache/states/
//snapshot.cpuprofile`.

```
$ moon run --profile cpu app:lint
```

### Analyze in Chrome[​](#analyze-in-chrome)

CPU profiles can be reviewed and analyzed with
[Chrome developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) using the following steps.

- Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://inspect`.

- Under "Devices", navigate to "Open dedicated DevTools for Node".

- The following window will popup. Ensure the "Profiler" tab is selected.

- Click "Load" and select the `snapshot.cpuprofile` that was [previously recorded](#record-a-profile). If successful, the snapshot will appear in the left column.

On macOS, press `command` + `shift` + `.` to display hidden files and folders, to locate the
`.moon` folder.

- Select the snapshot in the left column. From here, the snapshot can be analyzed and represented with [Bottom up](#bottom-up), [Top down](#top-down), or [Flame chart](#flame-chart) views.

## Heap snapshots[​](#heap-snapshots)

Heap profiling lets you detect memory leaks, dynamic memory problems, and locate the fragments of
code that caused them.

### Record a profile[​](#record-a-profile-1)

To record a heap profile, pass `--profile heap` to the [`moon run`](/docs/commands/run) command. When
successful, the profile will be written to
`.moon/cache/states/
//snapshot.heapprofile`.

```
$ moon run --profile heap app:lint
```

### Analyze in Chrome[​](#analyze-in-chrome-1)

Heap profiles can be reviewed and analyzed with
[Chrome developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) using the following steps.

- Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://inspect`.

- Under "Devices", navigate to "Open dedicated DevTools for Node".

- The following window will popup. Ensure the "Memory" tab is selected.

- Click "Load" and select the `snapshot.heapprofile` that was [previously recorded](#record-a-profile-1). If successful, the snapshot will appear in the left column.

On macOS, press `command` + `shift` + `.` to display hidden files and folders, to locate the
`.moon` folder.

- Select the snapshot in the left column. From here, the snapshot can be analyzed and represented with [Bottom up](#bottom-up), [Top down](#top-down), or [Flame chart](#flame-chart) views.

## Views[​](#views)

Chrome DevTools provide 3 views for analyzing activities within a snapshot. Each view gives you a
different perspective on these activities.

### Bottom up[​](#bottom-up)

The Bottom up view is helpful if you encounter a heavy function and want to find out where it was
called from.

- The "Self Time" column represents the aggregated time spent directly in that activity, across all of its occurrences.

- The "Total Time" column represents aggregated time spent in that activity or any of its children.

- The "Function" column is the function that was executed, including source location, and any children.

### Top down[​](#top-down)

The Top down view works in a similar fashion to [Bottom up](#bottom-up), but displays functions
starting from the top-level entry points. These are also known as root activities.

### Flame chart[​](#flame-chart)

DevTools represents main thread activity with a flame chart. The x-axis represents the recording
over time. The y-axis represents the call stack. The events on top cause the events below it.
