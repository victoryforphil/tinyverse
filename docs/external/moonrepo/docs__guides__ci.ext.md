# Continuous integration (CI)

All companies and projects rely on continuous integration (CI) to ensure high quality code and to
avoid regressions. Because this is such a critical piece of every developer's workflow, we wanted to
support it as a first-class feature within moon, and we do just that with the
[`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci) command.

## How it works[​](#how-it-works)

The `ci` command does all the heavy lifting necessary for effectively running jobs. It achieves this
by automatically running the following steps:

- Determines touched files by comparing the current HEAD against a base.

- Determines all [targets](/docs/concepts/target) that need to run based on touched files.

- Additionally runs affected [targets](/docs/concepts/target) dependencies and dependents.

- Generates an action and dependency graph.

- Installs the toolchain, Node.js, and npm dependencies.

- Runs all actions within the graph using a thread pool.

- Displays stats about all passing, failed, and invalid actions.

## Configuring tasks[​](#configuring-tasks)

By default, all tasks run in CI, as you should always be building, linting, typechecking, testing,
so on and so forth. However, this isn't always true, so this can be disabled on a per-task basis
through the [`runInCI`](/docs/config/project#runinci) or [`local`](/docs/config/project#local) options.

```
tasks:  dev:    command: 'webpack server'    options:      runInCI: false    # Or    preset: 'server'
```

caution

This option must be set to false for tasks that spawn a long-running or never-ending process, like
HTTP or development servers. To help mitigate this, tasks named `dev`, `start`, or `serve` are false
by default. This can be easily controlled with the [`local`](/docs/config/project#local) setting.

## Integrating[​](#integrating)

The following examples can be referenced for setting up moon and its CI workflow in popular
providers. For GitHub, we're using our
[`setup-toolchain` action](https://github.com/moonrepo/setup-toolchain) to install moon. For other
providers, we assume moon is an npm dependency and must be installed with Node.js.

- GitHub
- Buildkite
- CircleCI
- TravisCI

## Choosing targetsv1.14.0[​](#choosing-targets)

By default `moon ci` will run all tasks from all projects that are affected by touched files and
have the [`runInCI`](/docs/config/project#runinci) task option enabled. This is a great catch-all
solution, but may not vibe with your workflow or requirements.

If you'd prefer more control, you can pass a list of targets to `moon ci`, instead of moon
attempting to detect them. When providing targets, `moon ci` will still only run them if affected by
touched files, but will still filter with the `runInCI` option.

```
# Run all builds$ moon ci :build# In another job, run tests$ moon ci :test :lint
```

## Comparing revisions[​](#comparing-revisions)

By default the command will attempt to detect the base and head revisions automatically based on the
current CI provider (powered by the [`ci_env`](https://github.com/milesj/rust-cicd-env) Rust crate).
If nothing was detected, this will fallback to the configured
[`vcs.defaultBranch`](/docs/config/workspace#defaultbranch) for the base revision, and `HEAD` for the
head revision.

These values can be customized with the `--base` and `--head` command line options, or the
`MOON_BASE` and `MOON_HEAD` environment variables, which takes highest precedence.

```
$ moon ci --base  --head # Or$ MOON_BASE= MOON_HEAD= moon ci
```

## Parallelizing tasks[​](#parallelizing-tasks)

If your CI environment supports sharding across multiple jobs, then you can utilize moon's built in
parallelism by passing `--jobTotal` and `--job` options. The `--jobTotal` option is an integer of
the total number of jobs available, and `--job` is the current index (0 based) amongst the total.

When these options are passed, moon will only run affected [targets](/docs/concepts/target) based on
the current job slice.

- Buildkite
- CircleCI
- TravisCI

GitHub Actions do not support native parallelism, but it can be emulated using it's matrix.

.github/workflows/ci.yml

```
# ...jobs:  ci:    # ...    strategy:      matrix:        index: [0, 1]    steps:      # ...      - run: 'moon ci --job ${{ matrix.index }} --jobTotal 2'
```

- [Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs)

.buildkite/pipeline.yml

```
# ...steps:  - label: 'CI'    parallelism: 10    commands:      # ...      - 'moon ci --job $$BUILDKITE_PARALLEL_JOB --jobTotal $$BUILDKITE_PARALLEL_JOB_COUNT'
```

- [Documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/tutorials/parallel-builds#parallel-jobs)

.circleci/config.yml

```
# ...jobs:  ci:    # ...    parallelism: 10    steps:      # ...      - run: 'moon ci --job $CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX --jobTotal $CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL'
```

- [Documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/parallelism-faster-jobs/)

TravisCI does not support native parallelism, but it can be emulated using it's matrix.

.travis.yml

```
# ...env:  global:    - TRAVIS_JOB_TOTAL=2  jobs:    - TRAVIS_JOB_INDEX=0    - TRAVIS_JOB_INDEX=1script: 'moon ci --job $TRAVIS_JOB_INDEX --jobTotal $TRAVIS_JOB_TOTAL'
```

- [Documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/speeding-up-the-build/)

Your CI environment may provide environment variables for these 2 values.

## Caching artifacts[​](#caching-artifacts)

When a CI pipeline reaches a certain scale, its run times increase, tasks are unnecessarily ran, and
build artifacts are not shared. To combat this, we support [remote caching](/docs/guides/remote-cache), a
mechanism where we store build artifacts in the cloud, and sync these artifacts to machines on
demand.

### Manual persistence[​](#manual-persistence)

If you'd prefer to not use remote caching at this time, you can cache artifacts yourself, by
persisting the `.moon/cache/{hashes,outputs}` directories. All other files and folders in
`.moon/cache` should not be persisted, as they are not safe/portable across machines.

However, because tasks can generate a different hash each run, you'll need to manually invalidate
your cache. Blindly storing the `hashes` and `outputs` directories without a mechanism to invalidate
will simply not work, as the contents will drastically change between CI runs. This is the primary
reason why the remote caching service exists.

## Reporting run results[​](#reporting-run-results)

If you're using GitHub Actions as your CI provider, we suggest using our
[`moonrepo/run-report-action`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/moon-ci-run-reports). This
action will report the results of a [`moon ci`](/docs/commands/ci) run to a pull request as a comment
and workflow summary.

.github/workflows/ci.yml

```
# ...jobs:  ci:    name: 'CI'    runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'    steps:      # ...      - run: 'moon ci'      - uses: 'moonrepo/run-report-action@v1'        if: success() || failure()        with:          access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The report looks something like the following:

### Community offerings[​](#community-offerings)

The following GitHub actions are provided by the community:

- [`appthrust/moon-ci-retrospect`](https://github.com/appthrust/moon-ci-retrospect) - Displays the results of a `moon ci` run in a more readable fashion.

- [`kymckay/moon-ci-booster`](https://github.com/kymckay/moon-ci-booster) - Displays failing `moon ci` tasks as comments with error logs directly on your pull request.
